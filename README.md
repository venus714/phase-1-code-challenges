# phase-1-code-challenges
 These is of my project containing a grade calculator, a speed detector and a net salary calculator 

# Documentation
1) Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
    The first program  prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 
    A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.It then grades the students according to their marks

 2) Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
    The second program  takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

    For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points,       the function  prints: “License suspended”.

3) Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
    The last program's major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic    salary and benefits.It calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and     net salary. 
    Data gotten from KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
